# 📊 AI Tool Usage & Adoption Among High School Students

This repository contains two detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects that explore **AI usage patterns, adoption, and perceived usefulness** among high school students worldwide.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. `AI Tools Usage Among Global High School Students.ipynb`

#### 🔍 Objective:
Analyze how students across different countries and demographics use AI tools for learning, studying, and daily academic life.

#### 📌 Key Highlights:
- Gender-wise and grade-wise distribution of AI usage.
- Country-level visualization of AI usage trends.
- Visualization of AI use for specific tasks like studying or homework.
- Use of advanced Seaborn plots like `catplot` and `barplot`.
- Age grouping and classification.

#### 📊 Sample Visualizations:
- Genders and grades that use AI for studying.
- Heatmaps of AI use across continents.
- Age-wise and gender-wise stacked bar charts.

### 2. `AI Adoption, AI Tool Usage and Usefulness EDA.ipynb`

#### 🔍 Objective:
Examine how students perceive the **usefulness** of AI tools and how their **adoption rate** varies based on several categorical factors.

#### 📌 Key Highlights:
- Sentiment distribution on how useful AI tools are perceived.
- Classification by subjects (e.g., Math, Science, Arts).
- Visualization of "AI Adoption Frequency" vs "Perceived Usefulness".
- Grouped analysis by age, country, and educational background.

#### 📊 Sample Visualizations:
- Grouped bar plots of AI adoption vs non-adoption.
- Correlation between frequency of use and usefulness.
- Heatmaps and pie charts for sentiment analysis.
